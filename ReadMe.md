# Code Ninjas GDP Documentation

Encyclopedia for the pre-written functions within the Game Development Platform. Each documented function contains a description, example(s), and further reference. This is meant to be used offline through a browser on the students' computers. This is NOT intended as a live webpage accessible on the internet. This is also a tool for Senseis to use when helping ninjas. Each location is welcome to make their own changes to the content.

This was originally made for Code Ninjas The Woodlands and has since been adapted to locations across the country. I no longer work at Code Ninjas but I leave this repository up so Senseis and students can become more familiar with the Game Development Platform (as clear documentation was not available).
